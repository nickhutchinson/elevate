I find it sad that so many Windows developers launch their Command Prompt as
Administrator out of habit, because so much Windows software falls over if you 
don't have admin rights. And yet there's no decent analogue to Unix's `sudo`.

So I'm writing one. In Python. It doesn't do much of anything yet, but hopefully 
it will soon.
